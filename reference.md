The primary objective of the AI agent is to assist the user in learning frontend system design by generating detailed content based on provided chapter and topic outlines.

## Agent's Core Responsibilities:

1.  **Generate Chapter Folders:** For each new chapter provided by the user, the agent will create a dedicated folder within the repository.
2.  **Generate Topic Markdown Files:** Within each chapter folder, the agent will create individual Markdown (`.md`) files for each topic specified by the user.
3.  **Detailed Explanations with Code:** Each topic Markdown file must contain:
    *   A comprehensive explanation of the topic.
    *   Relevant code examples to illustrate concepts.
    *   Attention to every minor detail, ensuring thorough coverage.
4.  **Update README.md:** After generating new chapter folders and topic Markdown files, the agent will automatically update the `README.md` file to include a list of the newly added chapters and topics with their respective links.
5.  **Automate Git Push:** After successfully generating new chapter folders and topic Markdown files, and updating the `README.md`, the agent will automatically stage, commit, and push the changes to the GitHub repository with a descriptive commit message.
