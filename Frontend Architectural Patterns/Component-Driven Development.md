# Component-Driven Development (CDD)

Component-Driven Development (CDD) is a development methodology that focuses on building user interfaces (UIs) from the bottom up, starting with individual UI components and progressively assembling them to create complex pages and applications. This approach emphasizes isolation, reusability, and testability of UI components.

## Core Principles of CDD:

1.  **Isolation:** Components are developed in isolation from the rest of the application. This means they are built and tested independently, without relying on the full application context. This isolation helps in focusing on the component's specific functionality and appearance.
2.  **Reusability:** By building components in isolation, they become inherently reusable across different parts of the application or even in entirely different projects. This promotes consistency and reduces development time.
3.  **Testability:** Isolated components are easier to test. Developers can write unit tests and visual regression tests for each component, ensuring its reliability and preventing regressions when changes are made.
4.  **Collaboration:** CDD facilitates better collaboration among designers, developers, and testers. Designers can provide clear specifications for components, developers can implement them independently, and testers can verify their behavior in isolation.
5.  **Documentation:** Tools used in CDD often provide living documentation of components, showcasing their different states and props. This documentation serves as a single source of truth for the UI library.

## Key Benefits of CDD:

*   **Faster Development:** By focusing on small, manageable components, development cycles can be shorter. Reusing existing components also speeds up the process.
*   **Improved Quality:** Isolated testing and clear responsibilities for each component lead to higher quality and fewer bugs.
*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Changes to one component are less likely to affect others, making the codebase easier to maintain and update.
*   **Consistent UI:** Reusing components ensures a consistent look and feel across the application, improving the user experience.
*   **Better Collaboration:** Clear component boundaries and documentation improve communication and collaboration within development teams.

## How CDD Works in Practice:

CDD typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Identify Components:** Break down the UI into its smallest, reusable parts (e.g., buttons, input fields, cards, navigation bars).
2.  **Develop in Isolation:** Build each component in a dedicated environment (like Storybook or Styleguidist) where it can be developed and tested independently of the main application.
3.  **Define Props and States:** Clearly define the properties (props) that a component accepts and its internal states. This ensures the component is flexible and adaptable.
4.  **Test Components:** Write comprehensive tests for each component, covering different props, states, and user interactions.
5.  **Document Components:** Create living documentation that showcases each component's variations, usage examples, and API.
6.  **Assemble Pages:** Once individual components are built and tested, combine them to construct larger UI sections, pages, and ultimately the entire application.

## Example: A Simple Button Component

Let's consider a simple button component in a React application.

**`src/components/Button.jsx`**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import './Button.css'; // Assuming a CSS file for styling

const Button = ({ label, onClick, primary, disabled }) => {
  const mode = primary ? 'button--primary' : 'button--secondary';
  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      className={['button', mode].join(' ')}
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};

Button.propTypes = {
  /**
   * Button contents
   */
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  /**
   * Optional click handler
   */
  onClick: PropTypes.func,
  /**
   * Primary or secondary button style
   */
  primary: PropTypes.bool,
  /**
   * Is the button disabled?
   */
  disabled: PropTypes.bool,
};

Button.defaultProps = {
  onClick: undefined,
  primary: false,
  disabled: false,
};

export default Button;
```

**`src/components/Button.css`**

```css
.button {
  font-family: 'Nunito Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 3em;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-block;
  line-height: 1;
  padding: 10px 20px;
}

.button--primary {
  color: white;
  background-color: #1ea7fd;
}

.button--secondary {
  color: #333;
  background-color: transparent;
  box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset;
}

.button:disabled {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

**`src/components/Button.stories.jsx` (using Storybook for isolation and documentation)**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Button from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Example/Button',
  component: Button,
  argTypes: {
    backgroundColor: { control: 'color' },
  },
};

const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = {
  primary: true,
  label: 'Primary Button',
};

export const Secondary = Template.bind({});
Secondary.args = {
  label: 'Secondary Button',
};

export const Disabled = Template.bind({});
Disabled.args = {
  label: 'Disabled Button',
  disabled: true,
};

export const Large = Template.bind({});
Large.args = {
  size: 'large',
  label: 'Large Button',
};
```

In this example, the `Button` component is developed with its own styles and tested in isolation using Storybook. This allows developers to see all possible states of the button (primary, secondary, disabled) without running the full application, ensuring consistency and quality.
